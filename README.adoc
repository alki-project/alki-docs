# What is Alki?

Alki (AL-kai) is a Dependency Injection framework for Ruby. Alki is designed to help organize and scale your project,
so you can focus on the important stuff.
It can be used alongside frameworks such as link:projects/alki-rails.adoc[Ruby on Rails].

Some high level features:

* Easily manage objects and dependencies
* Enables writing reusable and testable code
* Requires no annotations, mixins, or other changes to your code.
* link:projects/alki-console.adoc[Developer console] (built on pry)
* Automatic link:projects/alki-reload.adoc[code reloading]
* Powerful link:projects/alki-dsl/README.adoc[DSL toolkit]
* Extensible

[[installation]]
## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'alki'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install alki

## Example

[NOTE]
Full "todo" example can be found https://github.com/alki-project/alki-examples/tree/master/todo[here]

Alki simplifies project organization by pulling out all of the "connective tissue"
that connects our classes and modules together, and puts them into a special object
called an Assembly.

There are many ways to use Assemblies, but the most common is to have a single
Assembly for a project, so that use case is very easy to do.
For example, if you hade a "todo" command line utility
project that you wanted to use Alki with,
all you would need to do to create
an Assembly for the project is add this file:

.lib/todo.rb
```ruby
require 'alki'
Alki.project_assembly!
```

This will create a module called `Todo` that is an empty assembly:

```
$ bundle exec irb -Ilib
2.4.0 :001 > require 'todo'
 => true
2.4.0 :002 > todo = Todo.new
 => #<Todo:21964520>
```

[[defining-elements]]
### Defining Elements

Adding things to the assembly requires an Assembly definition file.
By convention this is named `config/assembly.rb` and is built using a DSL.
There are a handful of different element types in Assemblies.
Elements can refer to other elements, and can be defined in any order.

Full documentation of the DSL can be found link:dsl/README.adoc[here].

Below is an example Assembly definition for the todo application
which uses a few of the core element types.

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  group :settings do <1>
    set(:home) { ENV['HOME'] } <2>
    set(:db_path) { ENV['TODO_DB_PATH'] || File.join(home,'.todo_db') }
    set :prompt, 'todo> '
  end

  service :interface do <3>
    require 'todo/readline_interface'
    Todo::ReadlineInterface.new settings.prompt, handler
  end

  service :handler do
    require 'todo/command_handler'
    Todo::CommandHandler.new db
  end

  service :db do
    require 'todo/store_db'
    Todo::StoreDb.new file_store
  end

  service :file_store do
    require 'todo/json_file_store'
    Todo::JsonFileStore.new settings.db_path
  end
end
```
<1> `group` allows bundling together subelements
<2> `set` defines simple values, like configration settings
<3> `service` defines our main application objects

Any element can be accessed directly from the assembly object.

```
$ bundle exec irb -Ilib
2.4.0 :001 > require 'todo'
 => true
2.4.0 :002 > todo = Todo.new
 => #<Todo:21964520>
2.4.0 :003 > todo.settings.prompt
 => "> "
2.4.0 :004 > todo.interface.run
> ?
All commands can be shortened to their first letters
print
add <description>
edit <id> <description>
complete <id>
uncomplete <id>
remove <id>
move <from> <to>
quit

```

The 'alki-console' developer console can also be used to quickly work with assemblies.
Add `gem 'alki-console'` to the Gemfile and run `bundle --binstubs`.

```
$ bin/alki-console
todo> settings.prompt
=> 'todo> '
```

[[executable]]
### Creating an executable

Read more about creating executables with Alki,
including how to create executables to distribute in a gem,
link:assemblies/executables.adoc[here]

In the todo example, it's a CLI utility so it requires an executable.
The executable just needs to require the main project file,
create a new instance of the assembly,
and call a method on a service.

.bin/todo
```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby

# Setup 
require 'bundler/setup'
require 'alki/bin'

require 'todo'
Todo.new.interface.run
```

```
$ bin/todo
> print
1. take out the trash
> quit
$
```

[[splitting]]
### Splitting up the Assembly

As a project grows, it's helpful to be able to split out
parts of the Assembly configuration into multiple files.

This can be accomplished with the link:dsl/load.adoc[`load`] method in the DSL,
which will load the named file and add it the elements
defined in it as a group in the assembly.

For example, it's common to split out application settings into
a separate config file.

.config/settings.rb
```ruby
Alki do
 set(:home) { ENV['HOME'] }
 set(:db_path) { ENV['TODO_DB_PATH'] || File.join(home,'.todo_db') }
 set :prompt, 'todo> '
end
```

.config/assembly.rb
```ruby
Alki do
  load :settings

  service :interface do
    require 'todo/readline_interface'
    Todo::ReadlineInterface.new settings.prompt, handler
  end

  ...
end
```
