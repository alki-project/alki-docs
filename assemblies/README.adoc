Assemblies
==========

If a set of classes are your raw materials,
an Assembly is the finished product,
ready to be used.

To get there,
you provide Alki with your assembly definition,
which acts as the instructions for how to piece together your
classes and objects.
Assemblies are made up of elements,
which are groups of other elements, or various value types like services and factories.

=== On-Demand

Assembly values are only built when referenced, on demand.
This means even if you have a very large assembly
only the things you actually use in a given run will be created,
or often even `require`-d.
It also means that all values will automatically be built
in the correct order to satisfy dependencies.
