Overrides
---------

Assembly overrides provide a way to configure or customize an Assembly when
constructing an instance.

For example, using the assembly created above, one might want to change the IO object logged to.

The simplest way to do this is to provide a hash which will override values in the assembly (as if the `set`
command was called in the DSL):

```ruby
require 'stringio'
io = StringIO.new
instance = assembly.new log_io: io
instance.util.logger.info "test"
puts(io.string.match(/INFO -- : test/) != nil)

# output: true
```

The limitation of this is that it can only override basic values. To override more complex elements
a block can be given to `new` allowing the full assembly DSL.

```ruby
class MyLogger
  def initialize(io)
    @io = io
  end
  def info(msg)
    @io.puts "INFO #{msg}"
  end
end

instance = assembly.new do
  group :util do
    service :logger do
      MyLogger.new original.log_io
    end
  end
end
instance.util.logger.info "test"

# output: INFO test
```

One thing of note is that elements from the assembly are accessible in overrides via the `original`
method, as seen above. This can also be used to access the original versions of elements that have
been overridden.
