Groups (group)
--------------

Groups are the basic way of organizing the elements of your Assembly. Creating elements at the top
level of an Assembly will place them in a root group, but subgroups are easily created via the `group`
command.

```ruby
require 'alki'
assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  group :sub_group do
    set :val, "hello world"
  end
end
puts assembly.new.sub_group.val

#output: hello world
```

Scoping is also done by group, so that an element will be found by searching through parent groups.

```ruby
require 'alki'
assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  set :val, "one"

  func :print do
    puts val
  end

  group :g1 do
    set :val, "two"

    group :g2 do
      func :print do
        puts val
      end
    end
  end
end

assembly.new.print

#output: one

assembly.new.g1.g2.print

#output: two
```
