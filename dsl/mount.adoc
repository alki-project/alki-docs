Mounting Assemblies (mount)
---------------------------

Other assemblies can be mounted into your Assembly using the `mount` command.

The first argument is what the element should be named in the parent assembly.
The optional second argument is the assembly to be mounted.
This can either be the assembly module,
or be a "require" string (relative path but no `.rb`).
It defaults to the element name.
If a string, Alki will attempt to `require` it, and then look for a matching constant.


```ruby
require 'alki'

other_assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  set :val, "one"

  # This is invalid as there is no such element as 'val2'
  set :invalid_val2 do
    val2
  end

  # Normally, this would also be invalid, but if mounted
  # in an assembly that has a 'val2' element, this works.
  set :root_val2 do
    root.val2
  end
end

assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  set :val2, "two"
  mount :other, other_assembly
end
instance = assembly.new
puts instance.other.val
#output: one

# Even though val2 exists in MainAssembly, it is not directly accessibly to elements
# within OtherAssembly
begin
  puts instance.other.invalid_val2
rescue => e
  puts e
end
# output: undefined local variable or method 'val2'

# This works, because root returns the root assembly, which has a 'val2' element
puts instance.other.root_val2
#output: two
```

In addition, `assembly` takes an optional third hash argument or a block which can be used to set
overrides in the same way `::new` does for assemblies. Elements from the parent assembly are
automatically in scope for overrides.

```ruby
require 'alki'
other_assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  set :msg, nil
  func :print do
    puts msg
  end
end

assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  set :val, "hello"
  mount :other, other_assembly do
    set :msg do
      val
    end
  end
end
assembly.new.other.print

#output: hello
```
