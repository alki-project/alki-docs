Overlay (overlay)
-----------------

Overlays are a way to transparently wrap services.
They work by taking the name of a service or a group
along with the name of an element to be used as the overlay,
plus some optional arguments.

When the named service is built
the overlay element will be called (with `.call`)
with the built service object and the optional arguments,
and it's result will be what's returned.

Factories work well as overlay elements.

```ruby
require 'alki'

assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  overlay :greeting, :exclaim, 3

  service :greeting do
    'Hello World'
  end

  factory :exclaim do
    -> (string,count) do
      string + ('!' * count)
    end
  end
end

puts assembly.new.greeting

#output: Hello World!!!
```
