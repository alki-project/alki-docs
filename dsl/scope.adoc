Scope
-----

The most important methods available in a value context
are other elements that are "in scope".
For example,
a value can reference a sibling element in the same group,
or any value in any ancestor group.
The order that elements are defined does not effect what is in scope.
All other elements are out of scope,
but can usually still be referenced
by finding an ancestor group that 'is' in scope,
and then drilling down
from there.

```ruby
require 'alki'
assembly = Alki.create_assembly config_dir: 'config' do
  set :val1, "1"

  group :main do

    group :sub_group do
      set :val2, "2"
    end

    set :values do
      [
        val1, # OK
      # val2, # ERROR
        sub_group.val2, # OK
        val3, # OK
      # val4, # ERROR
        other_group.val4, #OK
      ].join('')
    end

    set :val3, "3"
  end

  group :other_group do
    set :val4, "4"
  end

end
puts assembly.new.main.values

#output: 1234
```
