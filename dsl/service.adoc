Services (service)
------------------

Services are the key element Assemblies are typically made up of. Like the block form of `set`,
`service` takes a name and block, which will be evaluated once on-demand and the result cached.
Whereas `set` is a lightweight element for simple values, `service` provides more functionality
via overlays and tags.

Commonly a service will require the file that defines a class, and then constructs an instance of
that class.

```ruby
require 'alki'
assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  service :logger do
    require 'logger'
    Logger.new STDOUT
  end
end
assembly.new.logger << "hello\n"

#output: hello
```
