Basic Values (set)
-----------------

The simplest type of values are ones created via the `set` command. There are two forms of `set`.
One that just takes it's value as an argument, and another that takes a block.

```ruby
require 'alki'
assembly = Alki.create_assembly do
  # This form takes the value as the second argument
  set :val1, "hello"

  # INVALID! Value may not be a reference to another element
  # set :val2, val1

  # This form takes the value as a block.
  # Block is run once and result cached.
  # Allows referencing other elements
  set :val2 do
    val1
  end
end
puts assembly.new.val2

#output: hello
```
