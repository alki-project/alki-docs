=== DSL State

DSLs are always evaluated within a new instance,
so instance variables can be used to store state,
however, state can also be stored in the `ctx` hash,
which provides some advantages.

Data is passed into and out of a DSL via the `ctx` hash.
It is initially set using the hash provided to the
DSLs build method, but can be updated by code in the DSL.

Additionally, DSLs can be combined and when run together,
share a single ctx hash,
so it can be used to pass data between them.

The result of the build method will either be the full ctx hash, or just the value of `ctx[:result]` if it
exists (including if it's set to false or nil).

```ruby
require 'alki/dsl'

strings_dsl = Alki::Dsl.build 'alki/dsls/dsl' do
  init do
    ctx[:strings] = []
  end

  dsl_method :add do |val|
    ctx[:strings] << val
  end

  finish do
    sep = ctx[:separator] || "\n"
    ctx[:result] = ctx[:strings].join(sep)
  end
end
strings_dsl.build do
  add 'Hello'
  add 'World'
end
# result => "Hello\nWorld"

strings_dsl.build separator: ', ' do
  add 'Hello'
  add 'World'
end
# result => "Hello, World"
```
